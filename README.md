# Irisclassification
Iris Classification Project
This project uses machine learning techniques to classify Iris flower species into three categories: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica. The classification is based on four features of the flower:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
Dataset
The well-known Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples from each species. Each sample is labeled according to the species and includes the measurements of the sepal and petal dimensions.

Objective
The goal is to build machine learning models that can predict the species of an Iris flower based on these four measurements.

Machine Learning Algorithms Used
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Workflow
Data Preprocessing: The data is split into training and test sets, and feature scaling is applied.
Model Training: Multiple machine learning models are trained using the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated on the test set based on accuracy, and classification reports are generated.
Prediction: The best-performing models are used to make predictions on new data.
